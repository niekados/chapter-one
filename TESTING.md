## Validation

### HTML Validation

The HTML code for the Journey app was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). 

- **Validation Method**:
  - URI validation was employed for all pages that did not require user login.
  - Direct input validation was used for pages that required a login. The HTML code was extracted by viewing the page's source directly. 

#### Warnings:
- The `type` attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources. This warning appeared multiple times in the code but was left unchanged as it is not critical and does not impact functionality.
